# Pros and cons of TDD

Pros: 

TDD can lead to a better design as developers need to first think about how their code can be tested. It can also lead to higher productivity as developers can refactor code, knowing that bugs will be caught by tests. The tests will ensure that code changes will not break the existing functionality. Finally, developers avoid writing unnecessary code as the tests set requirements for the features.

Cons:

TDD can slow down the initial development since it requires writing tests first before developing features. In addition, the tests will need to change if the requirements change which could add overhead to test maintenance. TDD can also be challenging for developers that are new to it and requires an initial learning curve.
